# Part III: Design Principles

SOLID is a set of design principles that can guide us on how our classes should be interconnected, classes being coupled groupings of functions and data structures, and also on how these functions and data structures should be arranged. They also help guide our software structures used within modules and components.

We want software that:

- Tolerates change
- Are easy to understand
- Are the basis of components that can be used in many software systems

The principles should be applied at the module level, just above the level of code.

- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
- OCP: Open-Closed Principle
- LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle
- ISP: Interface Segregation Principle
- DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
