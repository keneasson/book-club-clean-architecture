## Foreword:

Comparison of building architecture and software architecture, where buildings must respect laws of physics and gravity. Software on the other hand, is recursive and comprised of smaller and smaller blocks or modules of software.

Software has no intrinsic physical representation. Visualizations of software are but preferences. Software does bump up against some physical limitations in terms of CPU and memory, and network bandwidth. Additionally, time, money and effort define the scale of the software. These qualities also define the effectiveness.

Maintenance should be daily task, not its own project. How do we predict the required changes. Many paths from here. Strict and rigid, vs speculative generality.

Good architecture comes from understanding it more as a journey than a destination.

## Preface:

The rules of software architecture are independent of every other variable. Code boils down to sequence, selection and iteration, just as it did in the 50s and 60s. The building blocks of programs hasnâ€™t change, so neither have the rules on how to order them. Only, back then, the rules were unknown and often broken over and over.
